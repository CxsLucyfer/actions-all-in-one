# SecureStack - One Github Action To Rule Them All

This Action provides comprehensive security coverage for your entire GitHub project workflow! This is the SecureStack kitchen sink and combines 3 different GitHub Actions into one awesome Action to rule them all!  When you add this Action to your repository it will:

* Analyze source code for sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, passwords, etc
* Analyze source code for any vulnerable third-party or open source libraries with our software composition analysis  
* If your app is running in the public cloud we'll analyze it for cloud misconfigurations and inseure settings
* If your app has a public URL endpoint we will scan the public URL with our web vulnerability scanner
* Finally, we will build a SBOM for your application
